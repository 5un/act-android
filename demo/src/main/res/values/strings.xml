AGREEMENT

By agreeing on these terms and conditions, you will be involved in signing of the petition for the case for Carbon Dividends. Therefore, you agree on these terms:


IV: SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ROLLBACK
The final pillar is the elimination of regulations that are no longer necessary upon the enactment of a rising carbon tax whose longevity is secured by the popularity of dividends. Much of the EPA’s regulatory authority over carbon dioxide emissions would be phased out, including an outright repeal of the Clean Power Plan. Robust carbon taxes would also make possible an end to federal and state tort liability for emitters. To build and sustain a bipartisan consensus for a regulatory rollback of this magnitude, the initial carbon tax rate should be set to exceed the emissions reductions of current regulations.
